State v. Shapiro (1975)
Defendant charged with offense requiring a mental state of “knowingly” argued that the evidence
was insufficient because there was no indication she desired or hoped for a particular result.
Held: Conviction affirmed. Although a defendant who acted purposefully or who intended a
particular result certainly acted knowingly, MPC 18-103 makes clear there is no such
requirement.
State v. Bladow (2019)
Defendant argued that his conviction for aggravated arson MPC 18-402 was not supported by the
manifest weight of the evidence and that the State had not offered sufficient evidence of an intent
to cause physical harm to another person when he acted. Held: Conviction affirmed. The General
Assembly conspicuously used the “knowingly” mens rea in MPC 18-402, not “purposeful” or
language that mandates a specific intent to harm. Moreover, all that is needed for a conviction for
aggravated arson is “to create a substantial risk of serious physical harm to any person other than
the offender.” While actual harm is sufficient to satisfy MPC 18-402, it is not a necessary
element if a substantial risk of serious physical harm is present.
State v. Baker (2000)
As used in MPC 18-402, “substantial risk” means a strong possibility, as contrasted with a
remote or significant possibility, that a certain result may occur or that certain circumstances
may exist.
